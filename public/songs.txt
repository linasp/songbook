Oh well, in five years time we could be walking round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants, too
I'll put my hand over your eyes but you'll peek through

And there'll be sun, sun, sun all over our bodies
And sun, sun, sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun, sun, sun all over our faces
And sun, sun, sun, so what the heck

'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause its what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun, fun, fun when we were drinking
It was fun, fun, fun when we were drunk
And it was fun, fun, fun when we were laughing
It was fun, fun, fun, oh, it was fun

Oh well, I look at you and say it's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say, yeah well, I feel pretty a happy too
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love, love, love all through our bodies
And love, love, love all through our minds
And it'll be love, love, love all over her face
And love, love, love all over mine

And though admittedly all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking bout them as I'm lying in bed
And I know that admittedly it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

Oh, in five years time I might not know you
In five years time we might not speak
Oh, in five years time we might not get along
In five years time you might just prove me wrong
Oh, there'll be love, love, love wherever you go

There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love

[E] Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can [F#m] hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her
And you [E] know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she [G#m] feeds you tea and oranges that come [A] all the way from China
And just [E] when you mean to tell her that you [F#m] have no love to give her
Then she [E] gets you on her wavelength
And she [F#m] lets the river answer that you've [E] always been her lover

And you [G#m] want to travel with her, and you [A] want to travel blind
And then you [E] know that she will trust you
For you've [F#m] touched her perfect body with your [E] mind

[E] And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he [F#m] spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And [E] when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said [G#m] all men will be sailors then un[A]til the sea shall free them
But [E] he himself was broken, long [F#m] before the sky would open
For[E]saken, almost human, he [F#m] sank beneath your wisdom like a [E] stone

And you [G#m] want to travel with him, and you [A] want to travel blind
And then you [E] think maybe you'll trust him
For he's [F#m] touched your perfect body with his [E] mind

[E] Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's [F#m] wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the [E] sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she [G#m] shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are [E] heroes in the seaweed, there are [F#m] children in the morning
They are [E] leaning out for love and they will [F#m] lean that way forever
While [E] Suzanne holds the mirror

And you [G#m] want to travel with her, and you [A] want to travel blind
And then you [E] know that you can trust her
For she's [F#m] touched your perfect body with her [E] mind

[G] Catch a boat to [C] England, baby, [G] maybe to [C] Spain,
[G] Wherever [C] I have gone, [G] wherever I've [C] been and gone,
[G] Wherever [C] I have gone
The [D] blues [C] are all the [G] same.
 
[G] Send out for [C] whisky, baby, [G] send out for [C] gin,
[G] Me and room [C] service, honey, [G] me and room [C] service, babe,
[G] Me and room [C] service
Well, [D] we're living [C] a life of [G] sin
 
[G] When I'm not [C] drinking, baby, [G] you are on my [C] mind,
[G] When I'm not [C] sleeping, honey, [G] when I ain't [C] sleeping, mama,
[G] When I'm not [C] sleeping
Well, you [D] know you'll [C] find me [G] crying.
 
[G] Try another [C] city, baby, [G] another [C] town,
[G] Wherever [C] I have gone, [G] wherever I've [C] been and gone,
[G] Wherever I have gone
The [D] blues     [C] come following [G] down.
 
[G] Living is a [C] gamble, baby, [G] loving's much the [C] same,
[G] Wherever [C] I have played, [G] wherever I [C] throw them dice,
[G] Wherever [C] I have played
The [D] blues    [C] have run the [G] game.
 
[G] Maybe to[C]morrow, honey, [G]someplace down the [C] line,
[G] I'll wake up [C] older, [G] so much [C] older, mama,
[G] Wake up [C] older
And [D] I'll just [C] stop all my [G] trying.
 
[G] Catch a boat to [C] England, baby, [G] maybe to [C] Spain,
[G] Wherever [C] I have gone, [G] wherever I've [C] been and gone,
[G] Wherever [C] I have gone
The [D] blues [C] are all the [G] same.
